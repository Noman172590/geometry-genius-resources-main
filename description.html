                    The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

                    A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

                <p class="Qesp">
                    JavaScript provides six methods to select an element from the document.

                    getElementById = search element by element_id
                    getElementsByTagName = search element by tag name (e.g., span, div)
                    getElementsByClassName =search element by class name
                    getElementsByName= search element by name attribute
                    querySelector = returns the first element that matches the specified selector
                    querySelectorAll = returns elements that match the specified selector
                </p>

                <p class="Qesp">
                    Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model). It happens when an element receives an event, and that event bubbles up (or you can say is transmitted or propagated) to its parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element.
